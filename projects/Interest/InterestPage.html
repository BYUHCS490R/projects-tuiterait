        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Webtoons are korean comic books that were made to be read on a phone by the way the template of the comic book is.
        </p>
        <h3>Why I like it.</h3>
        <p>The  reason why I like it is because It is very accessible (on my phone) and you can find every kind  of genra on there, fantasy  (my favorite), superpowers, romance (ew), etc...
            I think the fact that it's online (mostly) makes it really popular for inspiring writter so the amount of webtoon available is infinite which is heaven if you love reading stuff.</p>
        
        <h3>What is a relative link</h3>
        <p>A relative link is one that instead of having the full web URL it only gives the path to the file, usually used when it's in the same folder/root folder.
        <a href="/projects-tuiterait/projects/Profile-Page.html">Relative Link</a>. A absolute link has the full web address.<a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Absolute Link</a>
