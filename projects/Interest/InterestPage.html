        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Webtoons are korean comic books that were made to be read on a phone by the way the template of the comic book is.</p>

        <h3>Why I like it.</h3>
        <p>The  reason why I like it is because It is very accessible (on my phone) and you can find every kind  of genra on there, fantasy  (my favorite), superpowers, romance (ew), etc...
            I think the fact that it's online (mostly) makes it really popular for inspiring writter so the amount of webtoon available is infinite which is heaven if you love reading stuff.</p>
        
        <h3>What is a relative link</h3>
        <p>A relative link is one that instead of having the full web URL it only gives the path to the file, usually used when it's in the same folder/root folder.
        <a href="/projects-tuiterait/projects/Profile-Page.html">Relative Link</a>. A absolute link has the full web address.<a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Absolute Link</a>

        <h2>My Color Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I chose <span class="highlight">red</span> to emphasize text and also because it fits the theme of the story I am talking about. I chose orange for his name for the exact same reason (his power is the sun).</li>
            <li>I chose <span class="smaller">gray</span> to de-emphasize text.</li>
            <li>I picked colors that are easy to read on the background.</li>
        </ul>
