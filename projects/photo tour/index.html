        <p>My tour is about the places and pictures that I got from my iPhone through out the summer! The cool thing is that most of it I got involved in it and did not only play tourist. For example the Stadium one it was actually somewhere I went to dance at the fiji tribute concert, the kumuwaiwai was my then summer work but now full time job and the pcc was my previous job.</p>
