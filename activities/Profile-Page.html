        I like life but fantasy and anything outside of the ordinary just <strong>makes me dream and escape a little bit normal life</strong>, so I love reading novels, webnovels, webtoons, mangas with something outside of the ordinary (magic or superpower) but I dislike TV series or Netflix that are too ressembling normal life, yes I can relate to it but if I wanted to see real life I would just live life and not waste my time on watching or reading this.

        Outside of school, I love <em>sports and music.</em> Volleyball and gym helps me stay 
        active and teaches me teamwork, while music lets me relax and find 
        inspiration. I believe both balance my life by keeping my mind free from  stress.
