    <p>Inline CSS is written inside a tag.  
    Embedded CSS is written in a &lt;style&gt; tag inside the HTML page.  
    External CSS is in a separate .css file that you link to the page.</p>

    <p>It keeps your code clean, makes changes easy, and can style many pages with one file.</p>
    
  <p>A selector tells CSS which HTML element to style.
