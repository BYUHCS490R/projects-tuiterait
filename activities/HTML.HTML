    <p>1.The internet is optic cables that connect all of our machines using protocols</p>
    <p>The web is a way to share information using the internet</p>
    <p>Git </p>
    <p>2.Github is a cloud based platform to store share and work on code. Its also pay for use unlike a Git.</p>
    <p>Git is a free and open source version control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers.</p>
    <p>I am unsure about how we are using Github but from what I know and what I found on the  web is  that github stores the code of somebody and when we access it it clones the code on our machine then when we upload it it will be created as another version. We use it for free and have a repository.</p>
