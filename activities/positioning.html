            What is snormal flow in HTML? <br>
            Normal flow is how elements naturally appear on a page before you change their position with CSS. Block elements stack on top of each other, and inline ones go left to right.

        <p> 
            What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float? <br>
            Float moves an element to the left or right and lets text wrap around it. You clear the float so the next part of the page doesn't get stuck beside it.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            What do absolute, fixed, and relative do? <br>
            Relative, absolute, and fixed all control an element's position. Relative moves it a little from where it normally sits, absolute places it exactly in a spot, and fixed keeps it still when you scroll.

            How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?<br>
            To make mobile navigation buttons, you use bigger buttons and stack them for easier tapping. CSS media queries help resize and move them neatly on smaller screens.
